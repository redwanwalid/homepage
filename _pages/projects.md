* **Delegated Access Control using Attribute-Based Encryption**<br>
Planned to solve some real-world issues and challenges faced in the EHR system stored on the cloud. Built an application using the Python Django framework. The application uses user attributes to control EHR access. ABE was used for encrypting EHR. Built an ontology following the HIPAA act to control access to different fields of an EHR. The framework allows search over encrypted data that was built using the searchable encryption techniques.<br>
